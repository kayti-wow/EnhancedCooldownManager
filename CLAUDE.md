**NOTE:** The code is undergoing a signficant refactor. Try to align with the new design.

## Design

MANDATORY: **ALL constants** are to be stored in Constants.lua.

The profile is split into GLOBAL and a SECTION specific to the module (typically matching the file name, in camel case).  See [Defaults.lua](Defaults.lua)

The intention is to use mixins as a kind of class hierarchy:
 ECMFrame -> BarFrame -> PowerBar|ResourceBar|RuneBar
 ECMFrame -> BuffBars

[ECMFrame](Mixins\ECMFrame.lua) owns:
- The "inner" Blizzard Frame
- Layout including positioning, anchor, border, background
- Refresh throttling
- Hiding

| Field         | Type            | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| IsHidden      | boolean\|nil      | Whether the frame is currently hidden. |
| IsECMFrame    | boolean           | True to identify this as an ECMFrame mixin instance. |
| InnerFrame    | Frame\|nil        | Inner WoW frame owned by this mixin. |
| GlobalConfig  | table\|nil        | Cached reference to the global config section. |
| ModuleConfig  | table\|nil        | Cached reference to this module's config section. |
| Name          | string            | Name of the frame. |
| GetInnerFrame | fun(self: ECMFrame): Frame | Gets the inner frame. |
| ShouldShow    | fun(self: ECMFrame): boolean | Determines whether the frame should be shown at this moment. |
| CreateFrame   | fun(self: ECMFrame): Frame | Creates the inner frame. |
| SetHidden     | fun(self: ECMFrame, hide: boolean) | Sets whether the frame is hidden. |
| UpdateLayout  | fun(self: ECMFrame): boolean | Updates the visual layout of the frame. |
| AddMixin      | fun(target: table, name: string) | Adds ECMFrame methods and initializes state on target. |

ECMFrame should work with _any_ frame the addon needs to position or hide.

[BarFrame](Mixins\BarFrame.lua) owns:
- StatusBar (values, color, texture)
- Appearance
- Text
- Ticks

BarFrame should work with any bar-style frame the addon is resposnible for drawing and updating.

[Bars\*](Bars\*.lua) owns:
- Event registeration and handlers
- Concrete implmementations for GetStatusBarValue, ticks, etc.

These responsibilities can change over time so update this document if so however responsibilities should not cross mixins by reaching into the internals of another. Always use public interfaces. Internal fields are prefixed by an underscore.

MANDATORY: Modules that derive from ECMFrame, must use the config accessors and never `ECM.db` or `ECM.db.profile` directly. NEVER create an intermediate table for profile/config.
- `self:GetGlobalConfig()` for the `global` config block
- `self:GetConfigSection()` for the module's specific block

MANDATORY: Modules should call methods in the immediate parent's mixin, if present. For example, `PowerBar:Refresh` must call `BarFrame.Refresh(self)` and never `ECMFrame.Refresh(self)`

MANDATORY: Any and all layout updates MUST be triggered from a call to `UpdateLayout()`. No cheeky workarounds, no funny business. MUST. Any change that modifies the layout outside of this function will be rejected.

MANDATORY: Any and all value-related updates should be triggered from a call to `Refresh()`.

MANDATORY: Files should have the following comment headings: "Helpers" -> "Options UI" -> "ECMFrame|BarFrame Overrides" -> "Event Handling" -> "Module Lifecycle". Place fields under the correct heading.

[Modules\Layout.lua](Modules\Layout.lua) owns
- Registering events that affect every ECMFrame such as hiding when the player mounts.
- Tells ECMFrames when to show/hide themselves, or when to refresh in response to global events.
- Managing both ECMFrames and Blizzard cooldown viewer frames.
- Global hidden state based on mount, rest area, and CVar conditions.

## Secret Values

Do not perform any operations except nil checking (including reads) on the following secret values except for passing them into other built-in functions:
- UnitPowerMax
- UnitPower
- UnitPowerPercent
- C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuraBySpellID

Most functions have a CurveConstant parameter that will return an adjusted value. eg.
```lua
UnitPowerPercent("player", resource, false, CurveConstants.ScaleTo100)
```
## Rewrite/Refactor

The following files have been mostly rewritten, but not everything is implemented:
- [Mixins\BarFrame.lua](Mixins\BarFrame.lua)
- [Mixins\ECMFrame.lua](Mixins\ECMFrame.lua)
- [Bars\ResourceBar.lua](Bars\ResourceBar.lua)
- [Bars\RuneBar.lua](Bars\RuneBar.lua)

The following files are partially rewritten:
- [Bars\BuffBars.lua](Bars\BuffBars.lua)

The following file will probably be removed:
- [Mixins\PositionStrategy.lua](Mixins\PositionStrategy.lua)

Store architectural details, status, and design choices and trade off decisions in [REFACTOR.md](docs\REFACTOR.md) so that you can reload your progress later. It is okay to make suggestions for design and architecture and layout, if it is a significant improvement or if the current design deviates wildly from what a reasonable developer in the WoW addon space would do.
